This code defines three functions to analyze two input strings in various ways, and a main function to execute these analyses.

shared_characters: Takes two strings as input, converts them to lowercase, and returns a sorted list of unique characters that appear in both strings, separated by commas.

unique_characters: Also takes two strings, converts them to lowercase, and returns a sorted list of unique characters that appear in either string but not in both, separated by commas.

non_occurring_alphabet_letters: Accepts two input strings, converts them to lowercase, and returns a sorted list of characters from the English alphabet that do not occur in either string, separated by commas.

The main function prompts the user to enter two strings, then calls each of the three functions in turn and prints their results, showing the shared characters, unique characters, and non-occurring alphabet letters between the two strings
